# Machine-Learning-For-Software-Engineers
 If you're a software engineer looking to add Machine Learning to your skillset, this is the place to start.

This course will teach you to write useful code and create impactful Machine Learning applications immediately. From the start, you'll be given all the tools that you need to create industry-level machine learning projects. Rather than reading through dense theory, youâ€™ll learn practical skills and gain actionable insights. Topics covered include data analysis/visualization, feature engineering, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and deep learning. All topics are taught with industry standard frameworks: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, and Keras.

Basic knowledge about Python is a prerequisite to this course.
